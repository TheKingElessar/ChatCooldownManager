# ChatCooldownHandler

There are two main modules to this mod.

### Hypixel Chat Cooldown

This mod checks if you have a rank on Hypixel. If you don't, it keeps you from sending chat messages too quickly, spacing them out automatically. If needed, tt will add all your messages to internal queues, ensuring you don't run into Hypixel's chat cooldown filter.

### Chat Character Count

This mod also increases the max chat character count on compatible servers. At the moment, this only works on single-player worlds and Hypixel. To do this, the mod uses a modified version of [Vanilla Enhancements'](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-enhancements) Chat module.
